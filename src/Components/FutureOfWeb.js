      <h1>Is the Future of Web Development Heading to a Dead End?</h1>
      <p>
        Here’s a wake up call for web developers if there ever was one!
        Developers, are you prepared?
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to start this article with a question, “Do you think web
        developers are heading towards a dead end?” or “Is the future of web
        development at stake?”
      </p>
      <p>These questions may shake you up and make you say, “wait, what?”</p>
      <p>
        After all, these are questions that can frighten web developers and
        designers who are currently working in the industry. First, let me
        define this, “What does a dead end for web developers mean?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, a dead end for developers means that there will be no job
        vacancies for developers or specific types of developers completely.
      </p>

        ‘Yuval Noah Harari’, an Israeli author, claims that the majority of jobs
        will disappear within the next 20 years. This also applies to all
        engineering-related positions. He provided some information on the
        various manual jobs that have vanished in the last three to four
        decades. Humans will be replaced by machines. These highlights from
        Yuval Noah Harari certainly serve as a wake-up call for web developers
        and designers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping this mind, I've attempted to highlight a few key elements that
        are crucial to understanding the future of web design and development
        below.
